            <h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>
            <h2>The JFK Assassination</h2>
                <p> A 2003 ABC News poll found that 70% of Americans believe Kennedy's death was the result of a broader plot. The trajectory of the bullets, 
                    some say, didn't square with Oswald's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Others suggest a second gunman — 
                    perhaps on the grassy knoll of Dealey Plaza — participated in the shooting. </p>

            <h2>Area 51 and the Aliens</h2>
                <p>Conspiracy theorists believe that the remains of crashed UFO spacecrafts are stored at Area 51, an Air Force base about 150 miles from Las Vegas, where 
                    government scientists reverse-engineer the aliens' highly advanced technology. Fodder for this has come from a variety of supposed UFO sightings in the 
                    area and testimony from a retired Army colonel who says he was given access to extraterrestrial materials gathered from an alien spacecraft that crashed 
                    in Roswell, N.M. Some believe that the government studies time travel at Area 51, also known as Groom Lake or Dreamland.</p>

            <h2>The Moon Landings Were Faked</h2>
                <p> Doubters say the U.S. government, desperate to beat the Russians in the space race, faked the lunar landings, with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin acting out 
                    their mission on a secret film set, located (depending on the theory) either high in the Hollywood Hills or deep within Area 51. With the photos and videos 
                    of the Apollo missions only available through NASA, there's no independent verification that the lunar landings were anything but a hoax.</p>
