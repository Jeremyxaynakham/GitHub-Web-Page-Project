            <h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>
            <h2>The JFK Assassination</h2>
                <p> A 2003 ABC News poll found that 70% of Americans believe Kennedy's death was the result of a broader plot. The trajectory of the bullets, 
                    some say, didn't square with Oswald's perch on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Others suggest a second gunman — 
                    perhaps on the grassy knoll of Dealey Plaza — participated in the shooting. </p>

            <h2>Area 51 and the Aliens</h2>
                <p>Conspiracy theorists believe that the remains of crashed UFO spacecrafts are stored at Area 51, an Air Force base about 150 miles from Las Vegas, where 
                    government scientists reverse-engineer the aliens' highly advanced technology. Fodder for this has come from a variety of supposed UFO sightings in the 
                    area and testimony from a retired Army colonel who says he was given access to extraterrestrial materials gathered from an alien spacecraft that crashed 
                    in Roswell, N.M. Some believe that the government studies time travel at Area 51, also known as Groom Lake or Dreamland.</p>

            <h2>The Moon Landings Were Faked</h2>
                <p> Doubters say the U.S. government, desperate to beat the Russians in the space race, faked the lunar landings, with Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin acting out 
                    their mission on a secret film set, located (depending on the theory) either high in the Hollywood Hills or deep within Area 51. With the photos and videos 
                    of the Apollo missions only available through NASA, there's no independent verification that the lunar landings were anything but a hoax.</p>

            <h2>Fetus farming</h2>
            <p>One of the darker conspiracy theories to come out in the past few years is the allegations of Planned parenthood conspiring to harvest baby organs to the black market as well as U.S Tax-funded research companies. 
                According to "Lifenews" article on Planned parenthood leaders admitting under oath that they have harvested body parts from fetuses that were still alive during an abortion. 
                one of the quoted testimonies in the article came from
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                " Jon Dunn, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties in California. His affiliate used to work with the fetal tissue companies DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, 
                which were shut down in 2017 after the Orange County District Attorney accused them of illegally selling aborted baby body parts. The companies agreed to close permanently and pay $8 million in a settlement " 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                while there are many questions yet to be answered on this bizarre conspiracy, the unknown only seems to fuel conspiracy theorists.</p>
